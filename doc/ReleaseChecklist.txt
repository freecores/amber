1. Run all tests in $AMBER_BASE/hw/tests with all combinations of the following;
    - Core: A23/A25
    - Library: Spartan6/Virtex6/Generic
    - AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG: on/off

2. Run boot-loader, ethmac-test, dhry and vmlinux with A23/A25

3. Synthesise both a23 and a25 cores. 
   Both cores must pass timing; Spartan6 at 40MHz, Virtex6 at 80Mhz, with max caches
   Check all synthesis warnings, clean up as many as possible.
   
4. Regenerate the vmlinux patch file, if any changes to the kernel source files.
